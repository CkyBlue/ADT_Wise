Run the command line version on browser: https://repl.it/@OverCky/ADT-Wise

The command line version project requires the colorama library to work.
Run it through main.py. It uses a clear screen function which 
only seems to work when running the program on a command line so it'll be best to 
view there.

Screenshots from the command line version on repl.it:

The GUI version is still under work. It relies on the Kivy framework.
The ADT backbone is also being worked from scratch for the GUI.

How the GUI is coming along:
