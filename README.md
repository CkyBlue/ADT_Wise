The project is basically a polished integration of programs I'd made during 
my A2 year to help me practise ADTs.

I intented for this program to be helpful to others that might be struggling
with ADT themselves. So far I've adapted hash-table and queue.

You can get a feel for how it is suppose to work by trying out 
'insert' on a queue. The live logs for the rest aren't ready. 

Run it through main.py.

I hope to get the rest adapted in time. The ones adapted are open to being 
refined. 

Adapted:
	Queue
	Hash-Table

Integrated:
	Queue

Postings:
