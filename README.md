The project is basically a polished integration of programs I'd made during 
my A2 year to help me practise ADTs.

I intented for this program to be helpful to others that might be struggling
with ADT themselves but so far I've only managed to adapt and integrate the Queue.

You can look at how running insert for queue works to see how I
intend for it to help someone better grasp the working of ADTs.

Run it through main.py. The program uses a clear screen function which 
only works when running the program on a terminal so it'll be easiest to 
view the program on terminal.

I hope to get the rest adapted in time. The ones adapted are open to being 
refined. The text that follows execution of 
parts of the entire sequence involved in a method such as insert or remove
are open to being altered. If they haven't benn introduced, you're welcome to
do so. You can refer to adt_queue to see how I chose to implement the
real-time log. If it pleases you, you could attempt to adapt my other ADTs or
make one on your own and integrate it.
