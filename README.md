The command line version project requires the colorama library to work.
Run it through CLI/main.py. It uses a clear screen function which 
only seems to work when running the program on a command line so it'll be best to 
view there.

The table shows data relevant to the ADT (index values, items values, pointer values etc.)
The text below it tries to explain what is going to happen next. It breaks down an ADT operation
such as insert.

Each index value has a unique color and is the same across index and pointer columns. 
This was intended to make it easier to follow the changes to pointers and index values.

Notice how the colors change as the explanation moves forward.
In the actual program, the program waits for user input before moving onto the next fragment of the 
ADT method so it is easier to follow.

The GUI version is still under work. It relies on the Kivy framework.
The ADT backbone is also being worked from scratch for the GUI.

How the GUI is coming along:
