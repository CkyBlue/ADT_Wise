This is me trying to polish programs I'd initially built to help
me better understand ADTs. I wanted to see if I could extend what I had
to make something that could be helpful for others learning CS as well.

So far, only queue (in the ADTs folder) is compatible with the integration
environment. The comments'll tell what's important to mind.

I hope to gradually modify my other adts practise programs so that the
integration can be extended.

If you want to contribute, you could modify the other ADTs on your own
to mirror Queue. The one's I integrate myself, I'll probably leave without
tending to the real-time log (I'm not sure if that's what a professional 
would call it) till I get the integrations out of the way.

If you want to contribute, you could add the log comments.

What I mean by those is basically text that follows execution of 
parts of the entire sequence involved in a method such as insert or remove.
You can look at how running insert for a queue works to see what I mean.

I intend to add persistent storage of created ADTs and if possible, I would
like to try to take it to a GUI.
