You can get a feel for how it is suppose to work by trying out 
https://repl.it/@OverCky/Queue, it's a modified adaptation of the Queue used here.

Until the live logs are up, all you can do is simply run commands on the other ADTs
and see what the effect is on internal variables such as pointer values.

Run it through main.py. The console version uses a clear screen function which 
only works when running the program on a terminal so it'll be best to 
view there.

I hope to get the rest adapted in time. The ones adapted are open to being 
refined. 

Adapted:
	Queue
	Hash-Table
	Stack
	Linked-list

Real-time log:
	Queue: 100% done
	Hash-Table: 0% done
	Stack: 0% done
	Linked-list: 0% done
	
---------------------------------------

If you want to contribute, feel free to tinker with the log texts for the
other ADTs.

Refer to adt_queue to look at how self.refresh() and self.post() are being used
for implementing the live log.
