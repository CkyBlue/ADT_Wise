Versions adapted for running on browser:
https://repl.it/@OverCky/Binary-Tree
https://repl.it/@OverCky/Queue

Run it through main.py. It uses a clear screen function which 
only works when running the program on a terminal so it'll be best to 
view there.

I hope to get other ADTs includeded in time.

Adapted:
	Queue
	Hash-Table

---------------------------------------

If you want to contribute, feel free to tinker with the log texts for the
other ADTs and register them in adt_logic.

Refer to adt_queue to look at how self.refresh() and self.post() are being used
for implementing the live log.
